# Next.js App Router Course

From https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/

## Getting Started

```
npm install
npm run dev
```


## Setup

### Seeding
The instructions for seeding are outdated (or the example code was outdated) but seeding data is actually in scripts/seed.js. You need to install dotenv, add  `scripts/seed.js` to the top of the seed script, and then from the project root run `node scripts/seed.js`. 


## Notes
This is the starter template for the Next.js App Router Course. It contains the starting code for the dashboard application.

For more information, see the [course curriculum](https://nextjs.org/learn) on the Next.js Website.
